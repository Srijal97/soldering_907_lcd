A PCB with support for OLED display instead of 8x2 alphanumeric LCD has been made on eagle. The iron works great and heats to:
- 200C in 20secs
- 250C in 51secs
- 300C in 1min, 14secs
- 350C in 1min, 34secs

on a 19V DC Power Supply. It would be much faster on a 24V supply.

I have 5 extra PCBs left, which I won't be using. So, if anybody wants one, I'll send it to you for just the shipping cost from Mumbai, India to your place.
